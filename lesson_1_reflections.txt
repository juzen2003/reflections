How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    The listing of different areas is helpful

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    keeping old files are always good since we might want to go back sometimes just for some old features , reusing or reviewing some old codes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: more flexible, we can decide when to commit
    cons: sometimes the changes between commits would be too small or too big

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    some are for codes or info that would normally related to multiple files, but some are for single file version control

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log: shows the history of commits with commits messages
    git diff: let you compare files difference in two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Since I know I can always go back to older version, I'm more confident of make extra changes.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    All git commands and features
