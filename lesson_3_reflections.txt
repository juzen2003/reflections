When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When multiple peopel are working on the same project or when we want to work at different places with all files synced up at the same place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes you would like to keep your local work while doing some changes that are not ready to be merged with codes on remote, if git just automatically do the pull for you, then some of your local work might get messed up.

    branches: different labels of commits
